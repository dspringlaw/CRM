# Bankruptcy Law Firm CRM

This repository contains a very small Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system tailored for a bankruptcy law practice. It is intentionally simple so that beginners can download the project and extend it as their needs grow.

## Features

- Manage client records (name, email, phone number)
- Manage bankruptcy cases associated with clients
- Web interface built with Flask and SQLite

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or newer
- pip (Python package manager)

## Setup

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the application:

```bash
python app.py
```

The application will start a local development server on http://localhost:5000.

## Customizing

This project uses Flask and SQLAlchemy, which are widely used and easy to extend. Feel free to add new fields or routes as needed. For production use, additional security, authentication and deployment considerations will be required.
